# Countries GraphQL & Angular

ðŸŒŽ My first toy project built with GraphQL & Angular

## Technologies

- Angular
- GraphQL w/ Apollo-Angular Client
- RxJS
- Material Angular

## Features

Using the [Countries Graphql API](https://github.com/trevorblades/countries) via `https://countries.trevorblades.com/`, the app can:

- Render a list of countries
- Display the flag of the country
- Name of the country and its capital
- List of language(s) spoken in the country
- Search for the language(s) spoken in the country. For example, inputting `germa` would definitely show at least 2 countries Germany and Austria
- Extra: select 2 languages from the list and open Google Translate in a new tab with languages preselected for translation
